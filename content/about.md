I am a Ph.D. student at Harvard University in [Ben de Bivort](http://debivort.org)'s lab studying individuality in odor preferences in fruit flies. Prior to this, I studied statistics and biological chemistry at the University of Chicago.

In my free time I like to make basketball-related data visualizations (especially about the Cleveland Cavs) -- you can see my posts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/d_lavrent).
