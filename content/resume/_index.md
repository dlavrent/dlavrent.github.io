## Research Experience

#### Graduate Student Researcher, de Bivort Lab (Harvard University)
- Developed a Python-based biophysical model of the fruit fly olfactory circuit, based on the wiring diagram from a real fly, capable of simulating dynamics of $\sim$3,000 neurons in response to odor stimuli (preprint on [*bioRxiv*](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.24.474127))
- Performing a Bayesian analysis of the olfactory circuit model to infer posterior distributions over biophysical parameters and compare capacities of different models to predict data (in prep)
- Building a novel fly-on-a-ball device that measures fly walking behavior while recording brain activity to study temporal variation in odor decision-making (in prep)
- Developed a random forest classifier that identifies fruit flies actively exhibiting signs of infection by the parasitic fungus *E. muscae* (contributed to article in [*eLife*](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85410))


#### Undergraduate Student Researcher, Dinner \& Rust Labs (University of Chicago)
- Developed a Python-based kinetic model of phosphorylation in the Kai proteins (the core circadian clock in cyanobacteria) and implemented Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference procedure to infer parameter values (published in [*Molecular Systems Biology*](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20199355))
